# A Todo App using React Native

This guide will walk you through the process of cloning and running a React Native app using Expo. Expo is a popular tool for developing and deploying React Native apps, and it provides a set of tools and services that make it easier to create and manage your project.

## Prerequisites

Before you can clone and run a React Native app using Expo, you'll need to install the following tools:

- Node.js
- [Expo CLI](https://docs.expo.dev/get-started/installation/) (optional)
- Git

## Cloning the Repo

- Open your terminal or command prompt.
- Navigate to the directory where you want to clone the repo.
- Run the following command to clone the repo:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/misterneo/todoapp-react-native.git
```

## ðŸš€ Running the App

- Navigate into the project directory using the cd command:

```sh
cd todoapp-react-native
```

- Install the required dependencies:

```sh
npm install
```

- Start the app using NPM:

```sh
npm start
```

- Start the app using Expo:

```sh
expo start
```

- Expo will start the development server and open a web page in your default browser with a QR code. This QR code is used to open the app on your phone.

- To view the app on your phone, install the Expo Go app from the App Store or Google Play.

- Once installed, open the Expo Go app and scan the QR code displayed in your browser.

- The app will be downloaded and installed on your phone, and you can start using it.

## Conclusion

Cloning and running a React Native app using Expo is a straightforward process. By following the steps outlined in this guide, you should be able to get up and running quickly. If you run into any issues, consult the Expo documentation or reach out to the project maintainers for assistance.
